Developer task for net-a-porter
Sam Dean 2010

It's currently using com.oneblacksock.doodler as the package name - you'll probably want to change that in Doodler-Info.plist to run it on an iPhone but it should just compile and run on the simulator as is :)


Email sam@oneblacksock.co.uk with questions / comments.



Thanks,

Sam
